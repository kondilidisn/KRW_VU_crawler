# VU.nl Crawler

This repository contains the code used in order to crawl the domain :
https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/ {ACADEMIC} /publications/

in order to extract all the publications for 4 academics.
The data was used as a proof of concept in order to present Biographies or Narratives for Accademics.
Specifically, the data was stored in the form of triples, and the code includes a function to etract them directly in turtle format.

The resulting Narratives are displayed here (also incorporating publication data from the Microsoft Academics KG, and some events provided manually):
